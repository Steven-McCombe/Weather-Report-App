# Weather-Report-App

## 💡 Description
To showcase my API and Javascript skills, I designed a weather forecasting application that takes in a users search criteria for a particular city and returns the current/forecasted weather conditions. The webpage uses two different API calls to collect data based on the users criteria. While building this I learned how powerful APIs can be when it comes to web design. It give me a great understanding in how they work and how they could be implemented in other projects.
